Database Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL with Data Integrity Assurance
Introduction
Database migration is a crucial process in modern database management, allowing organizations to move data between different database systems while ensuring data consistency and integrity. This document details the migration process from MySQL to PostgreSQL, including the steps to export schema and data, convert them for compatibility, and import them into PostgreSQL. The primary focus is on ensuring data accuracy and maintaining relationships during the transition.

Why Migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL?
MySQL and PostgreSQL are both popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they serve different needs:

PostgreSQL is known for its advanced features like full ACID compliance, robust indexing, JSON support, and extensibility.
MySQL is widely used for web applications and offers high performance but lacks some advanced features found in PostgreSQL.
Organizations often migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL for better performance, enhanced security, scalability, or compliance with business needs.

Migration Process Overview
The migration process consists of several key steps:

Exporting Schema and Data from MySQL
Converting MySQL Schema to PostgreSQL-Compatible Format
Creating a PostgreSQL Database
Importing the Schema and Data into PostgreSQL
Validating Data Integrity and Performing Verification
Step-by-Step Migration Process
1. Export Schema from MySQL
To begin, we export the database schema (tables, columns, indexes) from MySQL without including data:

sh
Copy
Edit
mysqldump -u root -p --no-data mydatabase > schema.sql
This command generates a SQL file containing the table definitions.

2. Export Data from MySQL
Next, we export only the data from the MySQL database:

sh
Copy
Edit
mysqldump -u root -p --no-create-info mydatabase > data.sql
This ensures that data is separated from the schema for easier conversion.

3. Convert MySQL Schema for PostgreSQL Compatibility
Since MySQL and PostgreSQL have some differences in syntax and data types, manual adjustments may be required:

Remove MySQL-specific features like ENGINE=InnoDB.
Replace AUTO_INCREMENT with SERIAL in PostgreSQL.
Convert TINYINT(1) to BOOLEAN.
Automated conversion tools like pgloader or manual adjustments using sed can be helpful:

sh
Copy
Edit
sed -i 's/ENGINE=InnoDB//g' schema.sql
4. Create a New PostgreSQL Database
A new PostgreSQL database must be created before importing the schema:

sh
Copy
Edit
createdb -U postgres newdatabase
5. Import Schema into PostgreSQL
After conversion, the modified schema file is imported into PostgreSQL:

sh
Copy
Edit
psql -U postgres -d newdatabase -f schema.sql
6. Import Data into PostgreSQL
Once the schema is in place, the actual data is imported:

sh
Copy
Edit
psql -U postgres -d newdatabase -f data.sql
Ensuring Data Integrity
Data integrity is critical when migrating between databases. Here are key validation steps:

1. Row Count Validation
Ensure the number of rows in each table matches between MySQL and PostgreSQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
2. Foreign Key Verification
Verify that relationships between tables are maintained:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
3. Sample Data Comparison
Randomly check data in both databases:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 10;
Automated Migration Script
To automate the migration, we use the following script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Define database credentials
MYSQL_USER="root"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
MYSQL_DB="mydatabase"
PG_USER="postgres"
PG_DB="newdatabase"

# Export schema from MySQL
mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD --no-data $MYSQL_DB > schema.sql

# Export data from MySQL
mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD --no-create-info $MYSQL_DB > data.sql

# Convert MySQL schema to PostgreSQL compatible format (manual step may be required)
sed -i 's/ENGINE=InnoDB//g' schema.sql

# Create PostgreSQL database
createdb -U $PG_USER $PG_DB

# Import schema into PostgreSQL
psql -U $PG_USER -d $PG_DB -f schema.sql

# Import data into PostgreSQL
psql -U $PG_USER -d $PG_DB -f data.sql

echo "Migration completed successfully. Verify data integrity manually."
This script automates the entire process, making it efficient and repeatable.

Best Practices for Database Migration
Backup the Source Database: Always create a backup of the MySQL database before migration.
Test on a Sample Dataset: Perform migration on a test environment before moving to production.
Use Transactions for Large Migrations: This prevents partial data imports in case of errors.
Monitor and Log Errors: Enable detailed logging to troubleshoot issues.
Perform Post-Migration Testing: Compare schema, run queries, and verify integrity.
Conclusion
Migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL is a multi-step process that requires careful planning, schema conversion, and data validation. By using the structured approach outlined in this document, along with an automated script, organizations can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining data integrity. Proper testing and validation ensure that the migrated data remains accurate, reliable, and consistent across both database platforms.
